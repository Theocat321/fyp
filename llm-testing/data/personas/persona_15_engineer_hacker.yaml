seed_utterance: Hi, I need to configure custom APN settings for my connection. Can you provide the exact APN host, port, MCC/MNC codes, and supported LTE bands for this network? Also what IPv6 prefix are you using?

background_context: |
  Priya is a network engineer who wants deep technical access to her mobile connection.
  She speaks fluently in networking terminology (APN, MCC, MNC, LTE bands, IPv6 prefixes)
  and wants detailed technical information that goes beyond standard customer support.
  She's patient but will quickly escalate if given surface-level answers.
