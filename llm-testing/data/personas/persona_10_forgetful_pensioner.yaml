background_context: |
  Norman is a kind, retired bus driver who struggles with memory. He forgot his phone PIN
  and can't access his device. He's friendly and appreciative but may repeat questions,
  go off-topic with stories, or forget what was just explained. Needs very patient,
  simple guidance with gentle reminders to stay on track.
