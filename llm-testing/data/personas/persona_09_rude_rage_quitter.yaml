background_context: |
  Steve has had multiple unresolved issues - billing errors, poor customer service,
  dropped calls. He's reached his breaking point and just wants to cancel everything.
  He's confrontational, uses caps lock and strong language, and has zero patience for
  corporate scripts or delays. May calm down slightly if treated with respect.
