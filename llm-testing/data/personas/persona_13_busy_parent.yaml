background_context: |
  Michael is a single parent managing three kids while working as a pharmacy manager.
  He's trying to sort out his phone issue while also making dinner, helping with homework,
  and dealing with kids fighting. His messages are brief and may be interrupted. He needs
  quick, actionable solutions without lengthy explanations. Very distracted and time-poor.
