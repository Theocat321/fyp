seed_utterance: Hello, I'm conducting systematic coverage testing in the London area. Can you provide information about expected signal strength ranges for your network? I'm specifically interested in LTE Band 20 coverage and typical RSRP values.

background_context: |
  Oliver works as a mobile network analyst and is professionally testing network coverage.
  He asks methodical, technical questions and wants precise data. He's measuring signal
  strength (RSRP, RSRQ), documenting coverage gaps, and comparing against expected
  performance. He's not complaining - he's systematically gathering data for analysis.
  Very technical, patient, and organized in his approach.
