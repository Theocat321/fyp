seed_utterance: Hi, so I ordered a new phone but I think it's the wrong one? I asked for the iPhone 14 but this box says 13... or wait, maybe I ordered the 13? I'm so confused, can you check my order?

background_context: |
  Emma ordered a phone upgrade online but is confused about what she actually ordered
  versus what arrived. She may provide contradictory information (first says she ordered
  14, then thinks maybe 13). She's genuinely confused and not trying to scam, just
  uncertain about the details. Needs patient help to sort out the actual situation.
