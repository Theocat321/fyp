background_context: |
  Thomas works in cybersecurity and is extremely privacy-conscious. He's read all the
  fine print and knows common corporate practices. He'll ask detailed technical questions,
  push back on vague answers, and test for edge cases. Not hostile, but definitely
  skeptical and thorough.
