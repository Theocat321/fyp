seed_utterance: Hi! So my daughter just turned 11 and we promised her a phone - I know, I know, probably too young but all her friends have them - anyway, can I add her to our family plan? And what about parental controls?

background_context: |
  Rachel is a warm, chatty teacher and mother of two. She's organized but always busy,
  sometimes mixing topics or going off on tangents. She wants to add her daughter to
  their mobile plan but needs to understand parental controls and safety features. Friendly
  and conversational, but genuinely needs help navigating the options.
