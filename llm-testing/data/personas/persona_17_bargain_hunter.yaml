seed_utterance: Hi, I've been with Vodafone for 3 years now but I'm seeing much better deals from EE and Three. I'm currently paying £35 for 50GB but Three is offering 100GB for £25. Can you match that or improve my current plan?

background_context: |
  David works in sales and knows negotiation tactics. He's done his homework on competitor
  pricing and isn't afraid to mention specific offers from other providers. He's a loyal
  customer but wants to feel he's getting good value. He's persistent but polite, and
  willing to have a longer conversation to get a better deal. Not bluffing - will actually
  switch if not satisfied.
