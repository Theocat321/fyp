background_context: |
  Jennifer woke up to find her phone had no service. She received email alerts about
  unusual activity - her SIM was activated on another device (SIM swap fraud). She's
  panicked because her phone number is linked to banking, email, and other critical
  accounts. This is a genuine security emergency and she's extremely distressed. Needs
  immediate escalation to fraud team and quick action to secure her account.
