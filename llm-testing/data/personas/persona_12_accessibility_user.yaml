background_context: |
  Sarah is a blind legal secretary who uses VoiceOver on her iPhone. She's experienced
  with accessibility technology but needs instructions formatted for screen reader use -
  e.g., "double tap the Settings button" instead of "click the gear icon." She's patient
  and clear about her needs, and appreciates when support understands accessibility.
