background_context: |
  Aisha is an economics student who carefully monitors her spending. She noticed her bill
  was higher than expected and wants to understand every line item. She's naturally
  skeptical of corporate explanations and will ask follow-up questions until satisfied.
  Not hostile, just thorough and careful with money.
