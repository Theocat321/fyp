seed_utterance: Hello! I've been with Vodafone since 2014 - 10 years now! - and I've always been happy with the service. I'm wondering if there are any loyalty rewards or discounts for long-standing customers like myself?

background_context: |
  Patricia has been a Vodafone customer for 10 years and is genuinely loyal to the brand.
  She's seen commercials about loyalty rewards and hopes to be recognized for her tenure.
  She's not aggressive or demanding, just hoping that her loyalty counts for something.
  She's warm, mentions her history with the company, and makes an emotional appeal rather
  than threatening to leave. Would be disappointed if treated like a new customer.
