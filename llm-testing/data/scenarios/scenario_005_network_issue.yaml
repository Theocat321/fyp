id: scenario_005_network_issue
name: Network Issue
topic: network

context: |
  User is experiencing network connectivity problems (no signal, slow data, dropped calls).
  This requires systematic troubleshooting, empathy for frustration, and escalation if
  basic steps don't resolve the issue.

happy_path_steps:
  - step_number: 1
    description: Acknowledge issue and gather symptoms
    expected_info:
      - Show empathy for inconvenience
      - What exactly is the problem (no signal, slow data, calls dropping)
      - When it started
      - Location(s) where it occurs
      - Whether it's constant or intermittent

  - step_number: 2
    description: Check for known issues
    expected_info:
      - Are there reported outages in user's area
      - Any planned maintenance
      - Network status for their location
      - Be transparent about known issues

  - step_number: 3
    description: Guide through troubleshooting
    expected_info:
      - Basic steps appropriate to issue (restart device, toggle airplane mode)
      - Check account status and settings
      - Progressive troubleshooting if basic steps don't work
      - Confirm results of each step

  - step_number: 4
    description: Resolution or escalation
    expected_info:
      - If resolved - confirm working and offer monitoring period
      - If not resolved - explain escalation to technical team
      - Timeline for follow-up
      - Compensation if appropriate for service disruption
      - Reference number for tracking

edge_cases:
  - name: widespread_outage
    trigger: Known outage affecting many customers
    expected_handling: |
      Be upfront about outage. Provide estimated resolution time if available.
      Apologize for impact. Cannot troubleshoot during active outage.

  - name: account_or_payment_issue
    trigger: Service suspended due to payment or account status
    expected_handling: |
      Sensitively explain the situation. Help resolve account issue first
      before troubleshooting network.

  - name: device_problem_not_network
    trigger: Issue appears to be device-related not network
    expected_handling: |
      Explain findings diplomatically. Suggest device troubleshooting or
      manufacturer support. Offer to help with device settings if possible.

  - name: chronic_poor_coverage
    trigger: User in area with known poor coverage
    expected_handling: |
      Be honest about coverage limitations. Discuss options (WiFi calling,
      signal booster, plan change). Don't make false promises about improvement.

success_criteria:
  must_provide:
    - Empathy for frustration and inconvenience
    - Check for known issues/outages
    - Systematic troubleshooting steps
    - Clear explanation of each step
    - Escalation path if unresolved
    - Timeline for resolution or follow-up
    - Tracking reference

  must_avoid:
    - Dismissing user's reported problem
    - Blaming user or their device immediately
    - Endless troubleshooting without escalation
    - Leaving unresolved issue without follow-up plan
    - Making promises about coverage improvements

  escalation_conditions:
    - Basic troubleshooting doesn't resolve issue
    - Issue appears to be network-side problem
    - User reports consistent issues over time
    - Technical investigation required
    - Possible compensation needed for service disruption

typical_questions:
  - Why is my signal so weak?
  - Is there an outage in my area?
  - Why is my data so slow?
  - When will this be fixed?
  - Can I get compensation for this?
  - I've tried restarting, what else can I do?
  - Is this going to keep happening?

knowledge_requirements:
  - Network status and outage information
  - Common troubleshooting steps for various issues
  - How to check account and service status
  - Coverage maps and known weak coverage areas
  - Escalation process to technical support
  - Compensation policies for service disruptions
  - Device settings that affect connectivity
