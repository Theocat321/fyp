It\u2019s completely okay to have specific needs when it comes to your phone usage. \n\nSince you primarily use your phone for calls, you might want to consider a plan that offers good call minutes without unnecessary extras. Here are a couple of options that might suit you:\n\n### Lite Mobile\n- **Cost:** \u00a38/month\n- **Includes:** 200 minutes of calls, unlimited texts, and 2GB of data (mostly for Wi-Fi use).\n- **Limitations:** No roaming; speeds may slow after 2GB.\n\n### Everyday Mobile\n- **Cost:** \u00a315/month\n- **Includes:** Unlimited calls, unlimited texts, and 10GB of data (with basic EU roaming).\n- **Limitations:** No hotspot usage outside the UK.\n\nThe **Lite Mobile** plan could be a good fit if you don\u2019t need many call minutes, while the **Everyday Mobile** plan offers unlimited calls and might be a nice option if you want a little more flexibility. \n\nHow do these options sound to you?",
