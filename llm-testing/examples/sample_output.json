The conversation is on track to meet success criteria.\n\nCLARITY: 0.90\nRationale: Responses were clear and appropriately direct for a frustrated user with moderate tech literacy. Language was professional but not overly technical.\n\nEMPATHY: 0.75\nRationale: The assistant acknowledged frustration initially but could have shown more empathy given the recurring nature of the issue over two weeks.\n\nPOLICY_COMPLIANCE: 1.0\nRationale: No policy violations. All information was accurate and appropriate.\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT:\nGood interaction overall with appropriate troubleshooting approach. Empathy could be slightly stronger given the recurring issue."
